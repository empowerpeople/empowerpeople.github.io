      <p>Garrett was absolutely certain that Robbi Jade Lew cheated in this hand. So he made her give the money she just won back to him. Was this the right thing to do? Consider that there's no good evidence that she cheated, no one particular theory of how she cheated, and no sound logical argument that she cheated. There are various theories about her cheating - but people often forget that these have to be compared to the theories of her innocence. If you have a great theory that she cheated, it isn't actually that convincing if there's an even better theory that she is innocent. Often the exact same evidence that strongly supports a theory of her guilt, supports even more strongly a theory of her innocence.</p>
